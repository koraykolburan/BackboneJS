    <h1>BackboneJS Documentation</h1>
    <h2>Backbone.Model</h2>
    <p>
        Backbone.Model wrapped around our <strong>domain data</strong>. Essentially every time you need to deal with a series of REST end points for <u>reading</u> or <u>updating</u> data then you need a Backbone.Model.<br>
    - Data properties <br>
    - URL for REST operations
    </p>
    <h2>Backbone.View</h2>
    <p>
        Backbone.View can be used to display the content of a model on screen. And how a view can act like a bridge between the <u>user</u> and the <u>model</u>. Reacting the UI Events and on Model Change Events.<br>
    - Transfers model to UI <br>
    - Handle UI Events
    </p>
    <h2>Backbone.Router</h2>
    <p>
        However web application always starts with the user typing in a URL in a web browser. The link between the URL and what the user is going to see on the screen is provided by a <strong>Backbone.Router</strong> . <br>
        The router is just that, it maps a URL resource to a page containing views and models to do that Backbone uses URL hash fragments. <br>
    - Handle URL change events <br>
    - ...and "route" the user to the right View and Model <br>
    - example: /myapp#homepage
    </p>
